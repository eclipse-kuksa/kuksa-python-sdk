KUKSA Python Client and SDK is a part of the open source project [Eclipse KUKSA](https://www.eclipse.org/kuksa/).
More about Eclipse KUKSA can be found in the [repository](https://github.com/eclipse/kuksa.val).

## Introduction

KUKSA Python SDK provides both a command-line interface (CLI) and a standalone
library to interact with the
[KUKSA Databroker](https://github.com/eclipse-kuksa/kuksa-databroker).

The redesigned `kuksa_client.v2` API targets the `kuksa.val.v2` protocol and
offers both synchronous and asynchronous clients, plus a provider API. The
older APIs (`kuksa_client.grpc`, `kuksa_client.grpc.aio`,
`kuksa_client.KuksaClientThread`) are frozen and deprecated but remain
available for backwards compatibility.

## Building and Installing the KUKSA Python SDK

The fastest way to start using KUKSA Python SDK is to install a pre-built version from pypi.org:

```console
pip install kuksa-client
```

If you want to install from sources instead see the KUKSA Python SDK [Build documentation](https://github.com/eclipse-kuksa/kuksa-python-sdk/blob/main/docs/building.md).

## Using the Command Line Interface (CLI)

After you have installed the kuksa-client package via pip you can run the test client CLI directly by executing:

```console
kuksa-client
```

With default CLI arguments, the client will try to connect to a local Databroker supporting the `kuksa.val.v2` protocol without using TLS. This is equivalent to executing

```console
kuksa-client --server grpc://127.0.0.1:55555
```

One-shot commands are also available:

```console
kuksa-client get Vehicle.Speed
kuksa-client set Vehicle.Speed=42
kuksa-client subscribe Vehicle.Speed
```

More details on how to use the CLI is available in the KUKSA Python SDK [CLI documentation](https://github.com/eclipse-kuksa/kuksa-python-sdk/blob/main/docs/cli.md)

## Using Docker for the CLI

The KUKSA Python SDK CLI is available as a [prebuilt docker container](https://github.com/eclipse-kuksa/kuksa-python-sdk/blob/main/docs/docker.md).

## Using KUKSA Python SDK as library

The KUKSA Python SDK provides a synchronous and an asynchronous client for the
`kuksa.val.v2` protocol, plus a provider API. For more details see the KUKSA
Python SDK [Library documentation](https://github.com/eclipse-kuksa/kuksa-python-sdk/blob/main/docs/library.md).

```python
from kuksa_client.v2 import KuksaClient

with KuksaClient("127.0.0.1", 55555) as client:
    speed = client.get("Vehicle.Speed")
    print(speed.value)
    client.set({"Vehicle.Speed": 42})
```
